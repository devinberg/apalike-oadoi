# apalike-oadoi

**NOTE: The use of this bibliography style is no longer recommended due to oaDOI deprecating the DOI resolver.**

A small modification to the [apalike-refs](https://github.com/matthieu-vergne/LaTeX/blob/master/apalike-refs.bst) bibliography style for LaTeX to make use of [oaDOI](https://oadoi.org/).
